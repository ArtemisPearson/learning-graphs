# ðŸ“˜ Chapter 4: Linear Independence and Rank

Building on our understanding of **vector spaces** and **subspaces**, we now turn to an important question:  
> **When are vectors truly "different" from each other?**

This chapter focuses on **linear independence**, **dependence**, and the crucial matrix property known as **rank**.  
These ideas are the keys to understanding **when systems have unique solutions**, **how much information a set of vectors carries**, and **how efficient our models are**.

---

## 4.1 Linear Independence

**Definition:**  
Vectors are **linearly independent** if **none of them can be written as a combination of the others**.

**Formal Test:**  
Vectors \( \mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n \) are independent if the only solution to:
$$
c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n = \mathbf{0}
$$
is:
$$
c_1 = c_2 = \dots = c_n = 0
$$

**Otherwise**, they are **dependent**.

---

### Intuitive Picture

- **Independent Vectors**: Each vector points in a new direction not explained by others.
- **Dependent Vectors**: Some vectors "retrace" paths created by others.

**Creative Analogy:**  
Imagine you're giving directions:
- **Independent directions** are like adding truly new turns.
- **Dependent directions** are like repeating roads you've already traveled!

---

### Simple Examples

**Independent Example:**  
In \(\mathbb{R}^2\),
$$
\mathbf{v}_1 =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\\\
0
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{v}_2 =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\\\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
are independent â€” they point along different axes.

**Dependent Example:**  
$$
\mathbf{v}_1 =
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\\\
4
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf{v}_2 =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\\\
2
\end{bmatrix}
$$
are dependent because \( \mathbf{v}_1 = 2\mathbf{v}_2 \).

---

## 4.2 The Importance of Linear Independence

- **Solving Systems:**  
  Independent vectors correspond to **systems with unique solutions**.

- **Model Building:**  
  In machine learning or statistics, **independent features** avoid redundancy and boost performance.

- **Efficiency:**  
  Fewer independent vectors mean smaller models without losing information.

---

## 4.3 Rank of a Matrix

The **rank** of a matrix is the **dimension of its row space** (or equivalently, the column space).

**In simple terms:**  
- **Rank counts the number of truly independent rows or columns**.

### Finding Rank

You can find the rank of a matrix by:
1. Row reducing it to **Row Echelon Form** or **Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)**,
2. Counting the number of **leading 1s** (pivots).

**Example:**

Matrix \(A\):
$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\\\
2 & 4 & 6 \\\\
3 & 6 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Row reducing:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\\\
0 & 0 & 0 \\\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Thus, \(\text{rank}(A) = 1\).

---

### Key Properties of Rank

- \(\text{rank}(A) \leq \min(m,n)\) for an \(m \times n\) matrix.
- If \(\text{rank}(A) = n\) (number of columns), the columns are independent.
- If \(\text{rank}(A) = m\) (number of rows), the rows are independent.

---

## 4.4 Row Rank = Column Rank

One of the most beautiful facts in linear algebra:

> **The dimension of the row space equals the dimension of the column space.**

Thus, **row rank = column rank**, and we simply call it **the rank**.

**Why is this surprising?**  
Rows and columns "live" in different spaces â€” yet their structure carries the same amount of independent information!

---

## 4.5 The Rank-Nullity Theorem

This elegant theorem relates:
- **Rank** (number of independent columns),
- **Nullity** (dimension of the null space, i.e., number of free variables).

**Theorem:**
$$
\text{rank}(A) + \text{nullity}(A) = n
$$
where \(n\) = number of columns.

**Meaning:**  
Every variable in a system either:
- Contributes to a pivot (making the system more constrained), or
- Becomes a free variable (adding flexibility).

---

## 4.6 Why This Chapter Matters

Understanding independence and rank allows you to:

- Diagnose whether a system has a **unique solution, infinite solutions, or no solution**,
- Detect **redundancy** in your models,
- Simplify matrices for faster computation.

**Building on Earlier Ideas:**  
Now we aren't just describing **what vectors and matrices are** â€” we are judging **how rich or constrained** they are!

**What's Next:**  
We'll soon build a **geometric view of projections and orthogonality** â€” using these ideas to minimize errors and find best fits.

# ðŸ“š Summary

In this chapter, you learned:

- **Linear independence** means no vector can be made from others.
- **Linear dependence** reveals redundancy.
- The **rank** of a matrix counts independent rows/columns.
- **Row rank** and **column rank** are always equal.
- The **Rank-Nullity Theorem** ties together the dimensions of important matrix spaces.

Mastering rank and independence is essential for unlocking the deeper structure hidden inside linear systems and transformations!

# ðŸ§  Quiz

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>

A. 1

B. 2

C. 3

D. 5
</div>

??? Question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.  
    By the Rank-Nullity Theorem:  
    $$
    \text{rank} + \text{nullity} = \text{number of columns}
    $$
    So:  
    $$
    3 + \text{nullity} = 5
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    \text{nullity} = 2
    $$
